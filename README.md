This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Goals: 
  1. Refactor meltdown game using React
  2. Update to npm on the client side 
  3. Use new firebase API

## Reasons:
  1. All packages (nmp and bower) are way out of date
  2. Find out how does Phaser.js interact with React
    i. Renders fast?
  4. Angualr 1 is dead

### Tasks:

  1. Diagram or Whiteboard structure
  2. Setup server for backend
  3. Router?
  4. Redux?
  5. setup initial joining room - simple button click for now
    a. room name
    b. guest name 
  6. Mock firebase to start? 
    a. determine initial fb structure
    b. Mock json for firebase responses
      i. setup room
      ii. add guest(s) to room (should there be a link to share or just searchable room names? either way, you should always have the option to create room from any view in intro page)
      iii. add game/guest initial info
