This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Goals: 
  1. Refactor meltdown game using React
  2. Update to npm on the client side 
  3. Use new firebase API

## Reasons:
  1. All packages (nmp and bower) are way out of date
  2. Find out how does Phaser.js interact with React
    i. Renders fast?
  4. Angualr 1 is dead
